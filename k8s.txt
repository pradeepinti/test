Common #Kubernetes pod related errors and ways to mitigate them ☸

▶ ImagePullBackOff
When K8's is unable to retrieve the image for one of the pod's container
There are 3 common causes:
✔ Invalid image name
✔ Non-existent tag specified for the image
✔ Attempting to retrieve an image from a private registry without proper credentials
To resolve the first two cases, correct the image name and tag and for 3rd add the credentials for the private registry to a Secret and reference it in the pods.

▶ RunContainerError
Occurs when the container fails to start before the application
Common causes include:
✔ Mounting a read-only volume as read-write
✔ Mounting a non-existent volume, such as ConfigMap or Secrets
More detailed information can be obtained by describing the "failed" pod.

▶ CrashLoopBackOff
If a container fails to start, Kubernetes displays the CrashLoopBackOff status message
Possible reasons:
✔ An error within the application preventing it from starting
✔ Misconfiguration of the container
✔ The Liveness probe failing multiple times

▶ Pending Pods
If pods remain in a pending state, assuming the scheduler is functioning properly, the following may be causing it:
✔ Insufficient cluster resources, such as CPU and memory, to run the pod
✔ The current namespace has a ResourceQuota object, and creating the pod would exceed the quota
✔ The pod is associated with a pending PersistentVolumeClaim
To investigate these issues, it is recommended to examine the Events section in the output of "kubectl describe" command.
